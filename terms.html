          <p class="privacy__subtitle">25. Binding Arbitration.</p>
          <div class="text privacy__text">
            We hope we never have a dispute, but if we do, you and FinOctopus agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If we
            cannot, you agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Federal
            Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide, and the
            arbitrator’s decision will be final except for a limited right of review under the FAA. The dispute procedure and rules are
            following but not limited to: (i) Disputes Covered. Disputes includes everything except IP. The term “Dispute” is as broad as it
            can be. It includes any claim or controversy between you and FinOctopus concerning the products and services, the software
            related to the products, Super Dispatch account, advertising, marketing, communications, billing, or this EULA , under any legal
            theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of your or
            FinOctopus intellectual property rights. (ii) Notice of Dispute First. If you have a dispute and FinOctopus customer service
            representatives cannot resolve it, you must send a Notice of Dispute by U.S. Mail to FinOctopus LLC, ATTN: Legal Department,
            1617 Main St, Kansas City, MO 64108, U.S.A. (iii) Conflict with AAA Rules. These terms of this EULA govern to the extent
            they conflict with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules or Consumer Arbitration Rules. (iv) Filing Deadline. Parties agree to
            file in arbitration any claim or dispute (except intellectual property disputes) within six (6) month from when it first could be
            filed. Otherwise, it is permanently barred.
